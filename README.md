# Data Privacy Lab

## Overview
Welcome to the **Data Privacy Lab**! This repository contains implementations of essential privacy-preserving techniques, including:

- **K-Anonymity**: Ensuring that individuals remain indistinguishable within a group of k users.
- **L-Diversity**: Extending k-anonymity by maintaining diversity in sensitive attributes.
- **T-Closeness**: Further strengthening privacy by ensuring the distribution of sensitive attributes is close to the overall dataset.
- **Differential Privacy**: Adding noise to queries to prevent the exposure of individual records.

These techniques are crucial for protecting user privacy in datasets while allowing meaningful data analysis.
